<p> Wired Radio is the student radio station of Goldsmiths, University of London, broadcasting online seven days a week and home to over 96 hourly shows every term.  
</p>  

<p>


The station is run entirely for and by students, and has existed in various forms and locations since the mid 1990's.</p>

<p>Having been fully revived in the 2012, this year has seen Wired move home, into a brand new purpose built studio in the upper floor of the Students' Union on Dixon Road. We've kept our lovely old flowery sofa, too.  </p>

<p> The programming content of Wired is entirely decided upon by our hosts - we don't believe in forcing our shows to use prescribed station playlists and encourage all shows to be as creative and daring as possible (and legally viable).</p>

<p>Our aim as a station is to be as open to the  diverse Goldsmiths student base as possible. We allow students to broadcast their favourite music, their thoughts and own work. From hip-hop to Brazilian pop music, Wired is a diverse student media platform.

<p>We greet you with a warm welcome to the beginning of a new era for Wired Radio. With a brand new studio, a variety of old and new shows spanning the genres so wide we cant put it into words and a whole lot of new branding and new website, Wired is ready to go! </p>

<p>As the year goes on Wired will continuously be developing. We’re starting with simply getting on air but next; we shall be taking over the world, or at least just a small tiny section of SE14. </p>

<p>Regardless, plans of our very own video channel ‘Wired Eye’ are already undergo. We will use this channel for presenting events, promoting your shows and also for fun gimmicky things such as interviews at Club Sandwich. <br />
Other developments you shall witness with Wired consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting Wired Radio broadcasting around campus, be it in Natura or/and The SU shop</li>
<li>Having several events throughout the year in which our very own members will be the DJ’s, musicians or hosts.  Keep your eye wired to our Facebook for news of our LAUNCH PARTY!</li>
<li>Broadcasting live from Varsity with a variety of presenters (some who know sports, some who do not!).</li>
<li>Broadcasting live from other Goldsmiths events such as Comedy Nights and Simon Says.</li>
<li>Working with The Leopard to bring you daily news based updates that are relevant to Goldsmiths and the surrounding areas. </li>
</ul>

<p>With all that said and done, why are you still reading this? You should be listening online! <br />
Go on… We’ll even give you the link!</p>
